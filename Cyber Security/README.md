# Cybersecurity & Network Security Tools

This repository contains various Python scripts designed for cybersecurity and network security purposes. These tools can be used for network reconnaissance, encryption techniques, MAC address spoofing, keystroke logging, and other security-related tasks. **These tools are intended for security research and educational purposes only and should only be used on systems where you have explicit permission.**

## Contents

### ARP Poisoning
An ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) spoofing tool that manipulates network devices by sending false ARP messages. This allows the interception or redirection of network traffic.

### Keylogger
A Python-based keylogger that records keystrokes on a system. This tool captures keyboard input and logs it for analysis. **Use this tool only in authorized environments.**

### MAC Address Changer
A tool that modifies the MAC address of a network interface card (NIC). This can be used for anonymity or device impersonation within a network.

### Network Scanner
Scans a network to identify active devices and retrieve their IP addresses. Uses ARP requests to detect online hosts within a given subnet.

### Packet Listener
A tool for sniffing and analyzing network traffic. It captures HTTP requests and extracts potential sensitive information from network packets.

### Persistence Mechanism
A persistence mechanism that ensures a program remains active even after system reboots. Commonly used for maintaining access to a compromised system.

### Socket & Socket Listener
Socket-based communication tools that enable remote interaction between systems. These tools allow command execution on a remote machine.
